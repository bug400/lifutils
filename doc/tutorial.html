<H3><a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>Introduction</H3>

<p>The <em>LIFUTILS</em> are command line utilities to handle LIF files and LIF 
image files. LIF, the Logical Interchange Format was developed by
Hewlett Packard as a standard mass storage format that can be used 
for interchange of files among various HP computer systems. Although the
scope of application was much broader, the <em>LIFUTILS</em> are limited to
LIF files and image files for the HP calculators HP-41, HP-71 and HP-75.

<p>The <em>LIFUTILS</em> require basic knowledge of working with the command line on Unix, macOS or Windows. This knowledge must include working with pipes
and input/output redirection. A sound knowledge of working with files
on a HP calculator is needed as well.</p>

<p>If you definitely need a graphical user interface you may consider <a href="https://github.com/bug400/pyilper">pyILPER</a> which integrates many of the <em>LIFUTILS</em> programs in the graphical user interface of the virtual disk drive. See the <em>Start Up</em> section of the <a href="https://github.com/bug400/pyilper">pyILPER</a> user manual how to use this program stand-alone.</p>

<H3><a name="DEFINITIONS"></a>Definitions</H3>

<p>Understanding the following definitions is essential to work with the <em>LIFUTILS</em>.</p>

<H4>LIF Volume</H4>
<p>This is a physical data medium. Either a tape for the HP82161A tape drive or a floppy disk for the HP9114 disk drive.</p>

<H4>LIF Image File</H4>

<p>A LIF image file is a logical copy of a LIF Volume stored in a single file. 
It consists of a contiguous sequence of blocks of fixed 256 byte size. 
Any access to LIF image files occurs by reading or writing complete blocks.</b>

<p>The LIF image file contains the LIF file system which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume Header</li>
<li>Directory</li>
<li>File Area</li>
</ul>
<p>The volume header contains information about the size of the directory, the size of the LIF volume that the image file represents, the volume label and the date and time the image file was initialized. Some calculators or versions of HP-IL interface modules do not initialize the volume header properly. You may use the <a href="html/liffix.html">liffix</a> utility to amend the header information.</p>

<p>The size of the directory is specified at initialization of the LIF image file. The length of the directory in blocks is stored in the volume header. Each directory block can contain up to 8 directory entries with a size of 32 bytes.</p>

<p>Each directory entry has the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>File name</li>
<li>File type</li>
<li>Start block of the file in the file area</li>
<li>Number of blocks allocated for the file in the file area</li>
<li>Date and time the file was created, this entry may be blank</li>
<li>Implementation bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>The file name must apply to the file name rules of the HP-71: capital letters and digits starting with a letter. The maximum size is 10 characters. Note: the HP-41 allows file names which do not match the rules above. These files can not be processed with the <em>LIFUTILS</em>. Hence you can use the <a href="html/lifrename.html">lifrename</a> utility to rename these files.</p> 

<p>The file type is encoded as a numeric value. Most existing LIF file types are known to the <em>LIFUTILS</em> (at least all files types that exist in the <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-2520.html">Online LIF Disk Project</a>, but see <a href="#APPENDIX_B_MAPPING_FILE_TYPE_NAMES">Appendix B</a>). File types which are not known to the <em>LIFUTILS</em> are displayed as hex values in the output of the <a href="html/lifdir.html">lifdir</a> or <a href="html/lifheader.html">lifheader</a> command. Unknown file types can not be processed by the <em>LIFUTILS</em>. Note: neither <a href="html/lifdir.html">lifdir</a> nor <a href="html/lifheader.html">lifheader</a> print information about the file properties <em>private</em> or <em>secured</em>.</p> 

<p>The file types which are known to the <em>LIFUTILS</em> are listed in <a href="#APPENDIX_A_KNOWN_FILETYPES">Appendix A</a>.

<p>Nearly all LIF file types are calculator or application specific. The only file type that is interchangeable between the HP-41, the HP-71 and the HP-75 is the type <em>TEXT</em> (type code hex 0001).</p> 

<p>Many file types use specific additional information like file length in bytes, nibbles or registers, checksum information and so on in the implementation bytes. This information is essential to use the file in the calculator. The documentation of the implementation bytes is poor.</p> 

<p>In the file area the content of each file is stored in consecutive blocks. A frequent creation and deletion of files results in a fragmentation of the file area. Thus you might not be able to create a file although a sufficient number of free blocks is available. You can remove fragmentation of a LIF image with the <a href="html/lifpack.html">lifpack</a> utility.</p> 

<p>The recommended suffix for a LIF image file is ".img".</p>

<H4>LIF File</H4> 

<p> A LIF file contains the directory (LIF header) entry followed by the blocks with the file data. Since file type and implementation bytes are already present this file has all information that is needed to use it in a calculator. You can only import LIF files into a LIF image file with the <a href="html/lifput.html">lifput</a> utility.

<p>The LIF file is also used if the HP-71 copies a file to or from a HP-IL device of type interface (e.g. the HP82164A HP-IL/RS232 interface). This file type is also used by the DOSLINK device of some virtual HP-IL device emulators. The <a href="html/lifheader.html">lifheader</a> utility displays the information of the directory header of a LIF file.</p> 

<p>The recommended suffix for a LIF file is ".lif". </p> 

<H4>Raw File</H4>

<p>A raw file is "data only" without a LIF header. Use raw files only if you either need no "way back" to a LIF image file or if there is suitable software available to do that.</p>

<p>Building LIF files from raw files is possible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASCII text files (see <a href="html/textlif.html">textlif</a>)</li>
<li>compiled HP-41 Focal programs (see <a href=html/raw41lif.html>raw41lif</a>)</li>
<li>HP-41 ROMS (see <a href="html/rom41er.html">rom41er</a>, <a href="html/rom41hx.html">rom41hx</a> or <a href="html/rom41lif.html">rom41lif</a>)</li>
<li>HP-71 LEX, BIN or ROM data (see <a href="https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7585">alifhdr</a> not part of the <em>LIFUTILS</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should assign raw files a suffix that explains their file type.</p>

<H4> Further Readings</H4>
<p>
See <a href="https://www.finseth.com/hpdata/lif.php">this detailed description</a> of the LIF media and LIF file format. 
</p>

<H3><a name="WORKING_WITH_LIF_VOLUMES"></a>Working with LIF Volumes</H3>

<p>The only LIF Volume accessible by other devices is the 3 1/2 inch floppy disk used of the HP9114 disk drive. Unfortunately HP used an other physical recording format than the IBM PC. Therefore you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A computer system with a floppy disk controller that can be configured to do physical floppy disk access in the HP format. Expect that equipment most likely in PCs of the last century. USB floppy disk drives will definitely not work.</li>
<li>Driver support and a disk image copy utility</li>
</ul>

<p>For Windows the <a href="http://www.hp9845.net/9845/projects/fdio/">FDIO</a> project provides a driver and an image copy utility. This web site has much information about various low level floppy disk formats</p>

<p>Linux has built in driver support. If you have a suitable controller you 
can use the <a href="html/lifimage.html">lifimage</a> utility to create a LIF 
image from a floppy disk. The <a href="html/lifdump.html">lifdump</a> utility 
can write a LIF image file to a floppy disk. If the floppy disk controller 
is not capable to read or write the HP physical format in a correct way you will generally not get meaningful diagnostics.</p>

<p>There is no driver support for mac OS at all.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/articles.cgi?read=260">this document</a> how data blocks of a LIF image file are stored on a HP9114 floppy disk.</p>

<H3><a name="WORKING_WITH_LIF_IMAGE_FILES"></a>Working with LIF Image files</H3>

<H4>Create an empty LIF Image file</H4>

<p>The <a href="html/lifinit.html">lifinit</a> utilty creates an empty LIF Image file containing the LIF header with a blank label and an empty directory. The size of the directory must be specified on initialization and can not be changed afterwards.</p>

<p>You must also specify the medium type. The following medium types are emulated:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>cass</em>: HP82161A cassette (131 KB) </li>
<li><em>disk</em>: HP9114B double sided disk (616 KB)</li>
<li><em>hdrive1</em>: disk (640KB)</li>
<li><em>hdrive2</em>: disk (2MB)</li>
<li><em>hdrive4</em>: disk (4MB)</li>
<li><em>hdrive8</em>: disk (8MB)</li>
<li><em>hdrive16</em>: disk (16 MB)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>hdriveX</em> media types are only virtual and do not have a real counterpart. 16MB is the maximum size of a LIF medium. The HP-41 only supports cassette media. Hence the handbook of the HP9114 disk drive contains a program that enables the HP-41 to access the full 616 KB disk. Larger media are supported by
the HP-71 and the latest versions of the JPC rom.</p>

<H4>List the directory of a LIF image</H4>

<p>The  <a href="html/lifdir.html">lifdir</a> utility displays the content of the directory of the a LIF image file. It displays the medium layout and capacity and
for each file the following information:
<ul>
<li>File name </li>
<li>File type. If the file type is not known (<a href="#APPENDIX_A_KNOWN_FILETYPES">see Appendix A</a>) to the <em>lifutils</em> the hex
code of the file type is displayed.</li>
<li>Number of 256 byte blocks occupied by the file in the file area.</li>
<li>Actual size of the file. For some file types the actual file size can be
determined from the implementation bytes.</li>
<li>File creation date (may be empty)</li>
<li>File creation time (may be empty)</li>
<li>File start block in the file area (only at verbosity level 2)
<li>Number of blocks occupied in the file area (only at verbosity level 2)
<li>Implementation bytes (only at verbosity level 2)
</ul>

<p>The <em>-v</em> option controls the verbosity level of the directory listing. With verbosity level 0 (same as the <em>-n</em> option) only the file names are displayed. This can be used to create shell scripts or batch files that process multiple files of a LIF image.</p>

<H4>Export single files from a LIF image</H4>

<p>With <a href="html/lifget.html">lifget</a> you can retrieve a single file from a LIF image file. By default the resulting file is a LIF file. With the <em>-r</em> option the LIF header is removed and you get a raw file. The result is either written to a file or to standard output.</p>

<H4>Import single files into a LIF image</H4>

<p><a href="html/lifput.html">lifput</a> imports a LIF file into a LIF image file. The LIF file must have a valid LIF header with a filetype that is known (see <a href="#APPENDIX_A_KNOWN_FILETYPES">Appendix A</a>) to the <em>LIFUTILS</em> and a file name which must not exist in the directory of the LIF image file. There must be a sufficient contiguous number of free disk blocks in the file area of the LIF image file. If the file are is fragmented use the <a href="html/lifpack.html">lifpack</a> utility to pack the files in the file area. The input file can either be read from a file or from standard input.</p>


<H4>Rename a file</H4>
 
<p>The <a href="html/lifrename.html">lifrename</a> utility renames a file. The new name must not exist in the directory of the LIF image file. With this utility you can rename files as well which do not meet the HP-71 file name syntax (see above).</p>

<H4>Delete a file</H4>

<p>Use <a href="html/lifpurge.html">lifpurge</a> to purge a file from a LIF image.</p>

<H4>Miscellaneous Utilities</H4>

<ul>
<li><a href="html/lifpack.html">lifpack</a>: packs the file and directory area of a LIF image file to retrieve a contiguous free block to store files and to speed up directory searches</li>
<li><a href="html/liflabel.html">liflabel</a>: set, modify or remove the label of a LIF image file. The HP-71 can use labels instead of drive specifiers to access files.</li>
<li><a href="html/liffix.html">liffix</a>: some HP-IL controller create incorrect volume headers in LIF image files. Use this utility to fix them.</li>
<li><a href="html/lifstat.html">lifstat</a>: displays the block usage of a LIF image file. It can be used to check which files can be retrieved from corrupted media.</li>
</ul>

<H3><a name="CREATING_LIF_FILES_FROM_RAW_FILES"></a>Creating LIF files from raw files</H3>

<p>For some LIF file types the <em>LIFUTILS</em> provide programs to create LIF files with a valid LIF header and the necessary implementation bytes from raw data. You have ever to specify a valid LIF file name which must not exist in the destination LIF image file.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="html/textlif.html">textlif</a>: creates a LIF text file from an ASCII file. This file type can be used with the HP-71 (TEXT), the HP-75 (Interchange File) and the extended memory or HEPAX file system of the HP-41 (ASCII). The utility does not perform any character set conversion. <em>Note:</em> The <em>-r</em> option is mandatory if the LIF text file is to be used in the extended Memory or HEPAX Memory of a HP41-C. This parameter specifes the file size in registers and is stored in the implementation bytes of the LIF header. The HP-41 needs this information to allocate an appropriate amount of space for the file. If you specifiy the <em>-r</em> option without a size value then the register size is determined from the size of the ASCII file.</li>
<li><a href="html/raw41lif.html">raw41lif</a>: creates a HP-41 LIF program file from a HP-41 raw file. A HP-41 raw file which contains compiled FOCAL code can be converted from a FOCAL text file with the <a href="html/comp41.html">comp41</a> utility. <a href="html/rawlif.html">rawlif</a>  adds the necessary implementation bytes in the LIF header so that the file can be loaded into the HP-41 memory.</li>
<li><a href="html/rom41er.html">rom41er</a>: This utility creates a LIF file of type X-M41 from a raw HP-41 rom file. The output file contains the rom image in a specific compressed format that can be used by the ERAMCO MLDL-OS.</li>
<li><a href="html/rom41hx.html">rom41hx</a>: This utility creates a HP-41 sdata LIF file from a raw HP-41 rom file. The output file contains the rom image in a specific compressed format that can be used by the HEPAX <em>READROM</em> command.</li>
<li><a href="html/rom41lif.html">rom41lif</a>:This utility creates a HP-41 sdata LIF file from a raw HP-41 rom file. The output file contains the rom image in an uncompressed format that can be used to <a href="https://github.com/isene/hp-41cl_update">update the HP-41CL</a>.</li>
 </li>
</ul>

<H3><a name="UTILITIES_FOR_LIF_FILES"></a>Utilities for LIF files</H3>

<p>The <a href="html/lifraw.html">lifraw</a> utility removes the header from a lif file. The output is a raw file that can be used for a following processing.</p>

<p>The <a href="html/lifheader.html">lifheader</a> utility displays the content of the header of a LIF file. If you have a LIF file with unknown content you can examine the file with this command.</p>

<H3>Processing of raw files</H3>

<p>For the processing of raw files the following utilities exist:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="html/liftext.html">liftext</a>: Creates an ASCII text file from a LIF text file. The utility does not perform any character set conversion. </li>
<li><a href="html/text75.html">text75</a>: Creates an ASCII text file from a HP-75 text file. The utility does not perform any character set conversion.</li>

</ul>


<H3><a name="USING_THE_LIFUTILS"></a>Using the LIFUTILS</H3>

<H4>Using the LIFUTILS from the command line</H4>

<p>To use the <em>LIFUTILS</em> you must be familiar with the "command line". Either the shell on Unix or macOS or the command interpreter (CMD or PowerShell) on Windows. To get most benefit of the <em>LIFUTILS</em> you have to know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)">concept of pipelines and input/output redirection</a>.</p>

<p>Both concepts are implemented in Unix, macOS and Windows. The examples below work on all three operating systems. For the begin of pipe the command "cat" is used for Unix and macOS and "type" for Windows. You may also use &lt; for input redirection which works both on Unix/macOS and Windows but tends to make examples more confusing.</p>

<p>In most cases the <em>LIFUTILS</em> programs expect the source file on standard input and the destination file on standard output. You cannot specifiy the input or output file with command line parameters. An exception are LIF image files.</p>

<p>If you linke to convert the content of a raw HP-41 program with <a href="html/decomp41.html">decomp41</a> type:</p>

<pre>
cat/type example.p41 | decomp41 &gt; example.txt
</pre>

<p>This will <b>not</b> work:</p>
<pre>
decomp41 example.p41 example.txt
</pre>

<p>The <em>LIFUTILS</em> programs are "filters". They take the standard input, do a single conversion task and write the result to standard output. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)">concept of pipelines and input/output redirection</a> allows to daisy chain different "filters" in one statement to perform complex operations. Here an example to get print the HP-41 program <em>PROG41</em> that is stored into the LIF image file <em>lifimg.dat</em>:</p>
<pre>
lifget -r lifimg.dat PROG41 | prog41bar | barps | lpr
</pre>
<p>Note: lpr in this example is Linux specific.</p>

<H4>Using the LIFUTILS in scripts or programs</H4>

<p>The <em>LIFUTILS</em> programs are well suited to be used in scripts or to be called from programs. The following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>All input comes from standard input if not stated otherwise.</li>
<li>All output goes to standard output if not stated otherwise.</li>
<li>All diagnostic information (warnings or error messages) go th standard error.</li>
<li>The programs return 0 on successful completion and 1 on error.</li>
</ul>

<H4>Get files from a LIF image file</H4>

<p>To get the file <em>DATA1</em> from the LIF image file <em>liftest.dat</em> use the <a href="html/lifget.html">lifget</a> command: </p>

<pre>
lifget liftest.dat DATA1 data1.lif
</pre>

<p>This extracts the file DATA1 from the LIF image file into the file <em>data1.lif</em>. The file <em>data1.lif</em> is a LIF file. If you check with <a href="html/lifheader.html">lifheader</a> you get:</p>
<pre>
lifheader data1.lif 
File name           : DATA1     
File type           : e0d0 (SDATA) 
Data length         : 160
Number of blocks    : 1
Implementation bytes: 800100140020
</pre>

<p>To extract the file <em>DATA1</em> as a raw file and display its content with the <a href="html/sdata.html">sdata</a> utility type:</p>
<pre>
lifget -r liftest.dat DATA1 | sdata
+2.000000000E+1
+0.000000000E+0
+0.000000000E+0
</pre>

<p>The <em>-r</em> parameter removes the LIF header of <em>DATA1</em>. This is equivalent to use the <a href="html/lifraw.html">lifraw</a> utility:</p>
<pre>
lifget  liftest.dat DATA1 | lifraw | sdata
</pre>


<H4>Put files into a LIF image file</H4>

<p>The <a href="html/lifput.html">lifput</a> utility puts LIF files into a LIF image file. This means that you have to convert an input file to a LIF file first. For text files, HP 41 program and rom files this is covered in detail below.
To put the LIF file <em>data2.lif</em> into the LIF image file <em>liftest.dat</em> type:</p>
<pre>
lifput liftest.dat data1.lif
</pre>

<p>Note: If you insert a file into a LIF image file:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file must be a valid LIF file with a file type that is known (see <a href="#APPENDIX_A_KNOWN_FILETYPES">Appendix A</a>) to the <em>LIFUTILS</em></li>
<li>The name of the file must not exist in the directory of the LIF image file</li>
<li>There must be at least one free entry in the directory area and sufficient contiguous space in the file area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="html/lifdir.html">lifdir</a> utility gives information about the allocation of the directory and file area. If <a href="html/lifput.html">lifput</a> stores a file then it uses the first contiguous free block in the file area. If there is no suitable free block available due to fragmentation of the file area you can pack the LIF image file with the <a href="html/lifpack.html">lifpack</a> command.</p>

<H4>Create a new LIF image file</H4>

<p>You can create a new LIF image file with the <a href="html/lifinit.html">lifinit</a> command. You can specify the medium size (see above) and the size of the directory. Note: you can not alter the medium and directory size of an existing LIF image file.</p>

<p>To create an empty LIF image file <em>hpfloppy.img</em> with a medium size of the HP9114 floppy and 250 directory entries type:</p>

<pre>
lifinit -m disk hpfloppy.img 250 
</pre>

<p>You can add a volume label to a LIF image file with the <a href="html/liflabel.html">liflabel</a> command:</p>
<pre>
liflabel hpfloppy.img VOLA
</pre>

<p>Note: The label must only include capital letters and digits, starting with a letter. The maximum size is 6 characters.</p>

<p>To remove a label from a lif image file:</p>
<pre>
liflabel -c hpfloppy.img
</pre>


<H4>Fix invalid file names in a LIF image file</H4>

<p>You may find LIF image files with file names that do not comply with the more strict rules of HP-71 file names. These files can not be processed with the <em>LIFUTILS</em>. You can only rename them with the <a href="html/lifrename.html">lifrename</a> utility.</p>

<pre>
lifdir swapdk.dat
olume : SWAPDK , formatted : 05/08/87 23:23:57
Tracks: 77 Surfaces: 2 Blocks/Track: 16 Total size: 2464 Blocks, 630784 Bytes
USER4/1     TEXT          256/256    
...
M*M         PGM41         228/256 
...

</pre>
<p>To fix the illegal file name <em>M*M</em> use:</p>

<pre>
lifrename swapdk.dat "M*M" MTIMESM
</pre>


<H4>Working with text files</H4>

<p>To put an ASCII text file as LIF file into a LIF image file:</p>

<pre>
cat/type tdata.txt | textlif TDATA | lifput liftest.img
</pre>

<p>This example converts the ASCII file <em>tdata.txt</em> into a LIF file, prepends the LIF header with the file name <em>TDATA</em> and puts it into the LIF image file <em>liftest.img</em>. Note: This file can only be used with the HP-71B.</p>

<p>The HP-41 needs exact information how much space (in registers) shall be allocated in the HEPAX- or X-Memory. This size is specified with the <em>-r</em> parameter and stored in the implementation bytes of the LIF text file.</p>

<pre>
cat/type tdata.txt | textlif -r 0 TDATA | lifput liftest.img
</pre>

<p>If a value of 0 is specified the  number of  register is determined from the size of the input text file. If you intend to extend the file in the HP-41 later, you must choose an appropriate number of registers. The file size in registers is:</p>
<pre>
((number of characters + number of lines)+6)/7
</pre>
<p>According to the HEPAX documentation the maximum number of registers for a file is 577.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>The <a href="html/textlif.html">textlif</a> command does not perform any character set conversions.</p>

<p>To display the content of the text file <em>TDATA</em> in the LIF image file <em>lifimag.dat</em> type:</p>

<pre>
lifget -r liftest.img TDATA | liftext
</pre>

<p>Since <a href="html/liftext.html">liftext</a> expects a raw file as input the <em>-r</em> parameter is used with the <a href="html/lifget.html">lifget</a> command to strip the LIF header.</p>

<p>The text files encoded with <a href="html/textlif.html">textlif</a> and decoded with <a href="html/liftext.html">liftext</a> are called interchange files on the HP-75. The HP-75 uses an own text file format with a different LIF file type. This format can be decoded in the following way:</p>

<pre>
lifget -r liftest.img TDATA75 | text75
</pre>

<p>There is no utility to create HP-75 text files from ASCII files but you can copy the interchange file into the HP-75 and convert it into a HP-75 text file and vice versa with the <em>TRANSFORM</em> command.</p>

<H4>Working with HP-41 programs</H4>

<p>With the <em>LIFUTILS</em> you can work with HP-41 programs in various formats.</p>

<p>If you have an ASCII file with a HP-41 FOCAL program you can compile it into a raw file with <a href="html/comp41.html">comp41</a>. The following example compiles a FOCAL program <em>p41.foc</em> into a raw file <em>p41.raw</em>. This program uses commands from the HP-IL and Extended I/O rom, so we have to specify the corresponding xrom mapping files on the command line:</p>

<pre>
cat/type p41.foc | comp41 -x hpil -x xio &gt; p41.raw
</pre>

<p>You can use HP-41 program raw files in software emulators of this calculators.</p>

<p>To put the raw file <em>p41.raw</em> into the LIF image file <em>liftest.img</em> you must first create a LIF file from the raw file:</p>

<pre>
cat/type p41.raw | rawlif PROG41 | lifput liftest.img
</pre>

<p>Or put everything into one pipe:</p>

<pre>
cat/type p41.foc | comp41 -x hpil -x xio | rawlif PROG41 | lifput liftest.img
</pre>

<p>Both example store the compiled program with the file name <em>PROG41</em> into the lifimage file <em>liftest.img</em>.</p>

<p>To get the FOCAL code of a compiled HP-41 program use the <a href="html/decomp41.html">decomp41</a> utility. The following line prints the source of the file <em>PROG41</em> we just stored in the LIF image file <em>liftest.img</em>:</p>

<pre>
lifget -r liftest.img PROG41 | decomp41 -x hpil -x xio
</pre>

<p>Note: the <em>-r</em> option of <a href="html/lifget.html">lifget</a> removes the LIF header.</p>

<H4>Xrom mapping files</H4>

A compiled HP-41 focal programs references a call to a rom function with a rom number and a function number. The name of the rom function is stored in the function address table of the rom itself. The xrom mapping file contains the relation between the rom/function number and the function name for a specific rom. You can create a xrom mapping file yourself from a HP-41 rom file (see below).</p>

<p>If the xrom mapping file is omitted, then:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="html/decomp41.html">decomp41</a> displays external functions as XROM rr,nn</li>
<li><a href="html/comp41.html">comp41</a> throws an error if a rom function name was encountered. But it will compile XROM rr,nn calls correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>LIFUTILS</em> distribution provides a number of xrom files for the most popular HP roms. They are located in the <em>xroms</em> subdirectory of the software package. If you intend to add your own xrom mapping files you have the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Store the xrom file(s) in an arbitrary directory. Then you have to specify the full qualified path name for each file in that directory with the <em>-x</em> option.</li>
<li>Copy your own xrom mapping files and those provided by the <em>LIFUTILS</em> distribution into a directory. Let the environment variable <em>LIFUTILSXROMDIR</em> point to this directory.</li>
</ul>


<H4>Working with HP-41 ROM files</H4>

<p>For the HP-41 numerous plug in modules exist that extend the functionality of the calculator with additional commands, e.g. the Math module. These modules contain one or more roms with a size of 4 KWords (10bit words). The content of the roms of the HP-41 are available on various sources of the internet. The 10bit words of the rom are stored in two consecutive bytes. This file format is called an uncompressed (or unscrambled) rom image. The size of these files is always 8192 bytes.</p>

<p>With additional hardware (eprom or flash rom extenders) and software (HEPAX or Eramco MLDL-OS) you can exchange rom images between a HP-IL mass storage and the calculator. To improve efficiency HEPAX and Eramco MLDL-OS use different techniques to compress (or scramble) the rom images to store 4 consecutive 10bit rom words in 5 bytes. The scrambled files have a size of 5120 bytes.</p>

<p>With <a href="html/rom41er.html">rom41er</a> and <a href="html/er41rom.html">er41rom</a> you can convert an unscrambled rom image into an Eramco MLDL-OS scrambled LIF file and vice versa. This LIF file has an own file type.</p>

<p>The <a href="html/rom41hx.html">rom41hx</a> and <a href="html/hx41rom.html">hx41rom</a> convert between an unscrambled rom image an a HEPAX scrambled LIF file. This LIF file has the file type <em>SDATA</em>.

<p>To load the file <em>Math-1A.rom</em> as a scrambled HEPAX rom file into the LIF image file <em>liftest.img</em> do:

<pre>
cat/type Math-1A.rom | rom41hx MATHHXROM | lifput liftest.img
</pre>

<p>If you attach <em>liftest.img</em> to the <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/hpil.htm">ILPer</a> software suite (Windows) or the <a href="https://github.com/bug400/pyilper">pyILPER</a> program and a PIL-Box you can load the scrambled rom file into a HP-41 ram page with the HEPAX <em>READROM</em> command.</p>

<p>To list the content of the HEPAX scrambled HP-41 rom file <em>MATHHXROM</em> in the LIF image file <em>lifmag.dat</em> use:</p>

<pre>
lifget -r liftest.img MATHHXROM | hx41rom | rom41cat
</pre>

<p>This displays the function address table of the rom if present.</p>

<p>To create a xrom mapping file from an uncompressed HP-41 rom file <em>Math1A.rom</em> use the <a href="html/rom41cat.html">rom41cat</a> utility:

<pre>
cat/type Math-1A.rom | rom41cat -x &gt; math.xrom
</pre>

<p>Besides the rom files module files exist. They are used by software emulators and contain one or more rom images and additional information that describe properties of the module. You can not use module files in a calculator. If you have a module file you can extract the rom image(s) with the <a href="html/lifmod.html">lifmod</a> command:<p>
<pre>
lifmod -e Math.mod
</pre>

<p>Assembling mod files from rom image files is part of software development utilities for the HP-41 and beyond the scope of the <em>LIFUTILS</em>.

<H4>Script sample</H4>

<p>Below are sample script files for UNIX/mac OS and Windows that copy the whole content of a LIF image file to a new LIF image file with a different medium type and directory size.<p>

<p>Unix/mac OS sample script file:</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# copy files from a LIF image file to another new LIF image file
# check number of input parameters
if test $# -ne 4 
then
   echo "Usage: lifcopy lif-image-filename1 lif-image-filename2 medium-type dir-entries"
   exit 1
fi
# check if input file exists
if  test ! -r "${1}"
then
   echo "Input LIF image file does not exist"
   exit 1
fi
# check if output file does not exist
if test  -f "${2}"
then
   echo "Output LIF image file already exists"
   exit 1
fi
# initialize new image file
lifinit -m ${3} ${2} ${4}
if test $? -ne 0; then
   exit 1
fi
# copy content
for i in `lifdir -n ${1}`; do 
   lifget ${1} ${i} | lifput ${2} 
   if test $? -ne 0; then
      exit 1
   fi
done
exit 0
</pre>

<p>Windows sample script file:</p>
<pre>
@echo off
rem copy files from a LIF image file to another new LIF image file
rem check number of input parameters
set argC=0
for %%x in (%*) do set /A argC+=1
if not %argC% == 4 (
   echo Usage: lifcopy lif-image-filename1 lif-image-filename2 medium-type dir-entries
   exit /B 1
)
rem check if input file exists
if not exist %1 (
   echo Input LIF image file does not exist
   exit /B 1
)
rem check if output file does not exist
if exist %2 (
   echo Output LIF image file already exists
   exit /B 1
)
rem initialize new image file
lifinit -m %3 %2 %4
if errorlevel 1 (
   exit /B 1
)
rem copy content
for /F %%f in ('lifdir -n %1') do (
   lifget %1 %%f | lifput %2
   if errorlevel 1 (
      exit /B 1
   )
)
</pre>

<H3><a name="EXCHANGE_FILES_WITH_CALCULATORS"></a>Exchange files with calculators</H3>

<H4>PIL-Box</H4>

<p>You need a HP-41, HP-71B or HP-75 with a HP-IL interface and a <a href="http://www.jeffcalc.hp41.eu/hpil/">PIL-Box</a>. The PIL-Box is a HP-IL/USB translator. On the PC you need software that emulate at least a HP-IL mass storage device. You may try the <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/hpil.htm">ILPer</a> software suite (Windows) or the <a href="https://github.com/bug400/pyilper">pyILPER</a> program (Linux, Windows, macOS). Both software emulate various virtual HP-IL devices.</p>

<p>You can mount a LIF image file that was created or maintained with the <em>LIFUTILS</em> to a virtual drive of <a href="http://hp.giesselink.com/hpil.htm">ILPer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bug400/pyilper">pyILPER</a> and access the files on it with the file management commands of the calculator.</p>


<H4>Floppy disks</H4>

<p>You need a HP-41, HP-71B or HP-75 with a HP-IL interface and a HP9114 floppy disk drive. Using floppy disks with the <em>LIFUTILS</em> is <b>only</b> supported on Linux. You need a Linux PC with a non USB floppy disk drive. The success of reading or writing HP9114 compatible floppies is highly dependent on the capabilities of the floppy disk controller and the floppy disk drive.</p>

<p>On Linux you need read and write access to the floppy disk device /dev/fd0. Write access is even needed if you only intend to read a disk. Use the write protect switch on the disk to shelter your data. If you use a high density floppy then cover the indicator hole at the lower right side of the medium.</p>

<p>To get write access to a floppy disk device become member of the <em>floppy</em> group. Note: recent LINUX versions seem to set the group ownership of floppy disk devices incorrectly. To fix this either become super user or write an appropriate <em>udev rule</em>.

<p><em>LIFUTULS</em> programs that access a floppy perform a recalibration of the drive at start up. The recalibration always needs write access to the drive but does not write anything to the disk. During the recalibration error messages may occur. The recalibration needs some time to complete.</p>

<p>All <em>LIFUTIL</em> programs that access LIF image files can access a floppy drive if the <em>-p</em> parameter is specified. This option is only documented here. Because of the time consuming recalibration the preferred way is to exchange whole LIF image files with the floppy disk.</p>

<p>To copy a LIF image file you need a properly formatted floppy disk. The safest way is to format that disk with the HP-9114 drive. To copy the LIF image file <em>liftest.img</em> to a floppy disk use:</p>

<pre>
lifdump liftest.img /dev/fd0
</pre>

<p>Note: this will overwrite all data on the floppy disk.</p>

<p>To get a LIF image file as a copy of a LIF volume floppy disk use:</p>

<pre>
lifimage /dev/fd0 lifdisk.img
</pre>

<p>This copies all data on the floppy disk to the LIF image file <em>lifdisk.img</em>.

<p>Formatting a HP9114 compatible floppy seems to be more dependent to the capabilities of the floppy drive and the controller than reading and writing. If you have a lucky combination of drive and controller you may use the commands to format the disk:</p>
<pre>
# low level formatting
superformat --noverify /dev/fd0 dd sect=16 head=2 cyl=77 ssize=256
# high level formatting, use 250 entries in the LIF directory and zero the file area.
lifinit -p -z -m disk /dev/fd0 250
</pre>
<p>The <em>superformat</em> utility is part of the <em>fdutils</em> package in most LINUX distributions.</p>

<H4>Serial Interface</H4>

<p>You need a HP-41 or HP-71B with HP-IL interface and a HP 82164A HP-IL/RS-232C Interface and a PC with serial interface. For the HP-41 the Extended I/O module is needed as well.</p>

<p>The <em>LIFUTILS</em> provide tools to assist the exchange of files with the calculator. The serial communication with the HP 82164A box has to be configured at operating system level. Thus you need sound knowledge how to configure and operate serial devices on your PC and how to connect, set up and use the HP 82164A box.</p>

<p>The Extended I/O module of the HP-41 allows to send (<em>OUTP</em>) and receive (<em>INP</em>)  a program in hexadecimal format. The following utilities do encoding and decoding of these files on the PC:
<ul>
<li><a href="html/inp41.html">inp41</a>: reads and decodes a hexadecimal coded HP-41 program file sent by the Extended I/O module command <em>OUTP</em> to a raw file.</li>
<li><a href="html/outp41.html">outp41</a>: encodes a HP-41 program raw file into a hexadecimal byte stream that can be sent to the serial device and read by the HP-41 with the Extended I/O module <em>INP</em> command.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Linux you find information how to exchange data with the HP-41 in the file <a href="hardware/HP41-PC-serial-transfer">HP41-PC-serial-transfer</a> which is located in the hardware subdirectory of the <em>LIFUTILS</em> software distribution.</p> 

<p>The HP-71 allows to copy files from and to the HP 82164A serial interface with the <em>COPY</em> command. The HP-71 always exchanges LIF files (with the 32 byte header) with an HP-IL device of type <em>interface</em>. The following utilities are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="html/in71.html">in71</a>: reads and converts a transferred LIF file to a raw file.</li>
<li><a href="html/out71.html">out71</a>: converts an arbitrary raw file that can be sent to the serial device.  Warning: this utility might not add all necessary implementation bytes. You are strongly encouraged to use the raw to lif converters mentioned above for the supported file types (e.g. text files) and copy the converted files to the serial device.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Linux you find information how to exchange data with the HP-71 in the file <em>HP71-PC-serial-transfer</em>. This file is located in the hardware subdirectory of the <em>LIFUTILS</em> software distribution.</p> 

<H4>Using Barcodes</H4>

<p>You need a HP-41 with a bar code reader. There are two utilities that
convert HP-41 raw files to an <a href="html/barcode.html">intermediate barcode format</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="html/prog41bar.html">prog41bar</a>: for HP-41 raw program files</li>
<li><a href="html/sdatabar.html">sdatabar</a>: for HP-41 raw sdata files</li>
</ul>
<p>You can convert the <a href="html/barcode.html">intermediate barcode format</a> into a PostScript file with the <a href="html/barps.html">barps</a> utility. To create a printable barcode file <em>prog41.ps</em> from the HP-41 program <em>PROG41</em> in the LIF image file <em>lifimg.dat</em> type:</p>
<pre>
lifget -r lifimg.dat PROG41 | prog41bar | barps &gt; prog41.ps
</pre>

<p>To print a PostScript file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: send the output to the printer with the <em>lpr</em> command. Every Linux printer "knows" PostScript</li>
<li>mac OS:  open the document in Preview (found in your Applications folder). Preview will automatically convert your document into PDF format for viewing and printing.</li>
<li>Windows: If you have a PostScript printer then you can send the file to the printer device with the <em>COPY</em> command. You may use online services that convert PostScript into PDF and send the file to a printer with a PDF viewer. If you need a permanent solution you might consider the Acrobat Distiller or GhostScript.</li>
</ul>

<H4>Other solutions</H4>

<p>Other solutions which are documented in the <em>hardware</em> subdirectory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transferring files using a parallel printer interface and the HP82165 HPIL-GPIO interface. You need to solder a converter to connect the GPIO interface to the parallel interface of the PC.</li>
<li>Use a hardware modified HP-41 barcode reader to connect it to a parallel printer interface of the PC (requires more soldering).</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course the <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=1000">82973 HP-IL ISA interface</a> if you have one.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-2520.html">Online LIF Disk Project</a> maintains catalog files of the entire file collection. Hence the file type names used in these catalogs differ from the file type names implemented in the <em>LIFUTILS</em>. See the table below for a mapping.</p>
