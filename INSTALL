Installation instructions
=========================

LINUX
=====

* Install the autotools, automake tool chain

type:

         ./autogen.sh
         ./configure --prefix=(destination directory)
         ./make

PATH environment variable.

Windows
=======

LIFUTILS was cross compiled under LINUX. Building LIFUTILS on Windows should
be possible with either the Cygwin or MSYS development system.

MAC OS/X
========

It is recommended that you use the binaries supplied by the MacPorts Project:
https://www.macports.org. First install the Xcode Developer Tools. Open a
terminal window (as superuser) and type:

            xcode-select --install

After installation download and install the OS X Package install for your
operating system.

The software installed by the port utility requires the following environemnt variables:

            export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
            export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH

You should appy the setting of the environment variables to your .profile file.

To compile the LIFUTILS you must install the autotool, autoconf and automake
