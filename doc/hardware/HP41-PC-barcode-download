Downloading programs and data from a PC to an HP41 using a modified 82153 wand
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file describes a method for downloading programs and data to an HP41 
without using an 82160 HPIL module or any HPIL interfaces. Instead it 
uses a modified HP82153 barcode wand. A special interface connects to the 
wand circuitry and sends signals to the HP41 wand interface chip that are 
identical to those produced by the wand when it is scanned over a row of 
barcode. 

It is necessary to first construct the interface, the schematic of which 
is given in the file 'barcode-schematic' in this directory. This 
interface uses a programmed PIC microcontroller -- the source code of 
the program for this is in 'barcode.asm', an IHX8M hex file of the code 
is in 'barcode.hex'.

It is also necessary to modify the 82153 wand by adding an optoisolator 
as described in the file 'barcode-wand-mods'. The wand remains fully 
usable for reading barcode, but it can now also be connected to the 
interface.

Once all the hardware has been constructed, the interface should be 
connected to the PC parallel port and powered up. The wand optoisolator 
input should be connected to the interface as described in 
'barcode-wand-mods'. Throughout this document, the parallel port will be 
called /dev/lp0 . This should be changed to the correct name for the port 
on your machine.

It may be necessary to lengthen the printer strobe pulse, particularly if 
long, or poor-quality printer cables are used. If you experience Wand 
Checksum Errors or other similar problems, try 

tunelp /dev/lp0 -w 10

Testing the interface
--------------------
A test program, barcode-test.c, in this directory generates a 16 byte 
'row' of barcode as follows : 
Row :  1 , 16 bytes
HEX :  f0  e1  d2  c3  b4  a5  96  87  78  69  5a  4b  3c  2d  1e  0f
DEC : 240 225 210 195 180 165 150 135 120 105  90  75  60  45  30  15

Compile this program by typing

gcc -o barcode-test barcode-test.c 

(no makefile has been provided). Then connect the interface as described 
above and on the HP41 set the SIZE to at least 17 and type 

XEQ ~WNDSCN~

Reset the interface (press and release the reset button) and on the PC type
./barcode-test > /dev/lp0

The HP41 should beep and return 16 (the number of bytes in the row of 
barcode). Recall the registers 01 to 16 and check they contain the 
numbers given above in order. Further details of the WNDSCN command are 
given in the HP82153 Wand Owner's Manual.

Look for the following problems : 

Repeated numbers. This is caused by glitches on the strobe line caused, 
in turn, by a poor-quality printer cable. Try the tunelp command given above.

Some bits corrupted. Look for shorts on the interface board, check the 
PIC program

Totally dead. Check the interface power supply. Check that the PIC clock 
is running. Check interface construction. Check that the PIC is correctly 
programmed.


Downloading programs to the HP41
--------------------------------
On the HP41, ensure that there is enough space in program memory for the 
program you wish to download. Set SIZE appropriately if not.

Connect the wand to the HP41 and to the interface as described above. 
Reset the interface by pressing and releasing its reset button. Although 
this is not strictly necessary, it is good practice to do so before every 
download.

It is not necessary to enter any commands into the HP41. In fact with 
most wands, it's not even necessary to turn the HP41 on -- the first line 
of 'barcode' received by the wand will turn the system on.

On the PC, type

prog41bar < hp41-program > /dev/lp0

The HP$1 will beep as each row of barcode is downloaded. When the 
download finishes, type GTO .. on the HP41 to pack program memory.

The input to prog41bar can be piped from another program. For example type

lifget -f disk1.lif MYPROG | prog41bar > /dev/lp0 

to downloard a program called 'MYPROG' from a lif disk image 'disk1.lif'


Downloading data files (SDATA) to the HP41
------------------------------------------

On the HP41 set the SIZE appropriately, and put a number in x of the 
following format : bbb.eee , where bbb is the first register to load and 
eee is the last. Then XEQ WNDDTX. 

Reset the interface by pressing and releasing the reset button. It is 
good practice to clear the interface's data buffer in this way

On the PC, type

sdatabar < hp41-data > /dev/lp0

to download the sdata file 'hp41-data'. The HP41 will beep as each data
register is loaded. 

The input to sdatabar can be piped from another program. For example, to 
download the file DATA1 from the lif disk image disk.lif, type

lifget -f disk.lif DATA1 | sdatabar >/dev/lp0

In both cases it may be necessary to use the -e option to sdatabar if you 
have a version 1E wand and are getting wand data errors.
