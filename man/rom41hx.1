.SH DESCRIPTION
The HEPAX ROM set can load HP41 ROM images from disk. The file format is
a file of type
.I SDATA
which stores 4 10 bit HP41 words in 5 bytes of the file. A 4K ROM dump is thus stored in a 5120 byte file.
.PP
.B rom41hx
is a filter which generates a  LIF data file of type 
.I SDATA
from a HP41 rom file.
.PP
The filter reads the rom data from standard input and writes the LIF 
file header and the rom data in scrambled HEPAX format 
to standard output. Note: this filter adjusts an incorrect ROM checksum.
.SH EXAMPLES
If
.I HPILDv1B.ROM 
is the rom file of the HP-IL development module then
.PP
.B cat HPILDv1B.ROM | rom41hx HPILDEV | lifput lifimage.img
.PP 
will put the scrambled rom file with the name
.I HPILDEV
into the LIF image file
.I lifimage.img
