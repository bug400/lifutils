.SH DESCRIPTION
.B comp41
is a filter which compiles a text file containing a HP-41 user program (FOCAL)
and translates it to a binary raw file.
.PP
An 
.I xrom_file
consists of a number of lines, each consisting of 2 decimal numbers and a 
string (containing no whitespace), in that order, separated by whitespace. 
The string gives a name to the function specified by the first number as 
.I rr
and the second number as
.I nn.
A
.I xrom_file
is necessary to compile commands of module or peripheral functions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-g
Force global for[ "A..J", "a..e" ] with quotes: [ lbl "A" ]
.TP
.I \-l
Skip line numbers
.TP
.I \-x xrom_file
Use
.I xrom_file
to define names for functions in plug-in modules. This option may be 
repeated to load multiple
.I xrom_files.
The file name has to be specified either as a full pathname or as
the filename without the extension .xrom in the default location
that is specified with the environment variable LIFUTILSXROMDIR (see below).
.TP
.I \-?
Print a message giving the program usage to standard error.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I xroms/*
xrom function definition files. Use the environment variable LIFUTILSXROMDIR to point to the location of this
directory. On Linux the default location is /usr/share/lifutils/xroms, if the variable is not specified.
.SH REFERENCES
The format of an HP41C program is documented in many books. Amongst the 
most useful references are
.I Extend Your HP41 (W. A. C. Mier-Jedrzejowicz)
and
.I The HP41 Synthetic Programming Quick Reference Guide (Jeremy Smith)
.SH EXAMPLES
If
.I prog1.txt
is a text file with a FOCAL program that uses functions of the HP-IL and time module and
.I
hp41prog.dat
is a LIF image file
then
.PP
.B cat prog1.txt | comp41 \-x hpil \-x time | prog41hp PROG1 | lifput hp41prog.dat 
.PP 
will compile the file
.I prog1.txt
to a raw file that is transformed to a LIF file named
.I PROG1
that is stored in the LIF image file
.I hp41prog.dat
.SH BUGS
Unknown.
