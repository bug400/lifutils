.SH NAME
rom41 \- a filter to unscramble an Eramco ROM image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rom41 <
.I rom_file
.B > 
.I output_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Eramco MLDL-OS ROM set can save HP41 ROM images to disk, and the 
file format used has become a de facto standard for such images. It stores 4 
10 bit HP41 words in 5 bytes of the file. A 4K ROM dump is thus stored in
a 5120 byte file.
.PP
.B rom41
unscrambles such an image, storing each HP41 10 bit word in 2 bytes of 
the output file, and therefore a 4K image takes up 8192 bytes when 
unscrambled. The resulting output file, although larger, is easier to 
process with other programs.
.SH EXAMPLES
If 
.I myrom.rom 
is an HP41 rom image, produced by the Eramco MLDL-OS and stored in a 
linux file, then
.PP
.B rom41 < myrom.rom > myrom.out
.PP 
will unscramble the image and store the result in 
.I myrom.out
