.SH NAME
sdatabar \- Convert an SDATA file into HP41 barcode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sdatabar
[-e] 
.B <
.I input_file
.B >
.I barcode_file
.PP
.B sdatabar -?
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sdatabar
is a program that reads an SDATA file from standard input and writes the 
corresponding HP41 barcode file to standard output. Records in the SDATA 
file containing numeric data are turned into type 6 barcode rows, while 
those containing alpha data are turned into type 7 rows. Other SDATA 
records cannot be represented by HP41 barcode, and are skipped, giving a 
suitable error message.
.PP
The output of 
.B sdatabar
can be piped to a suitable barcode printing program such as 
.B barps
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-e
HP82153 barcode wands with the version 1E ROM have a bug which means they 
cannot read numeric data barcode rows containing 10 or more data bytes. 
Unfortunately, some HP41 real numbers require 10 bytes to represent them 
in barcode format. If the 
.I \-e
option is given to sdatabar, the program attempts to reduce the length of 
the barcode by omitting the decimal point and adjusting the exponent to 
compensate. This is not always possible, in which case, a suitable 
message is written to standard error, and the last mantissa digit is 
omitted from the barcode.
.TP
.I \-?
Print a message giving usage to standard error and exit
.SH REFERENCES
The format of HP41 barcode is given in the book
.I Creating your own HP41 Barcode (Hewlett\-Packard)
.PP
The format of the barcode file written by sdatabar is given in 
.I barcode(5)
.SH EXAMPLES
If
.I data1
is an sdata file, and 
.I postscript
is a postscript printer
then
.PP
.B sdatabar < data1 | barps 'Data File 1' | lpr -P postscript
.PP
will print that file on the postscript printer.
.SH BUGS
The HP82153 wand can't accept data other than standard numeric or alpha 
data, so some sdata files cannot be translated correctly. Version 1E 
wands cannot read some numeric data barcode, as described above.
