Corrected entry in xroms/hpil.xrom (PRUGE); 
Modified syntax of decompiled FOCAL programs to match syntax of nutstudio focal compiler:
P-&gt;R and R-&gt;P to P-R and R-P (byte_tables.h), insert space before exponent (prog41.c);
Introduce default path for xrom files. If they are located in /usr/share/lifutils/xroms only the file name without
extension must be specified in the -x option. Otherwise the full pathname can be specified to preserve the old
behaviour (prog41).
</td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.2</td><td>
Reimplemented physical media access (LINUX only, experimental!), lifput fixes 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.3</td><td>
Check for already existing file name: lifrename.c , check if the name in the lif header of the input file is valid: lifget.c
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.4</td><td>
Do not check if old file name is valid: lifrename. Check if directory size exceeds 1/3 of the medium size: lifinit.c, New files: lexcat71, lexcat71.1. File types renamed and added: lif_dir_utils.c
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.5</td><td>
New files: lifheader.c, lifversion.c, hx41rom.c, lifheader.1, hx41rom.1
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.6</td><td>
comp41 now also accepts ST+, ST-, ST/, ST* command syntax in addition to STO+, STO-, 
STO/, STO*.  rom41hx now corrects the rom checksum. This avoids a warning message if those files are loaded into HEPAX RAM. The files plotter.xrom, timecx.xrom, xfncx.xrom were added. The plotter emulator engine for the HP7470A plotter was added. This program is used as subprocess by the pyILPER application and not intended for stand alone use.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.7</td><td>
New files: er41rom.c, er41rom.1, rom41er.c (renamed rom41.c), rom41er.1 (renamed rom41.1), rom41lif.c, rom41lif.1. New CMake build system. MSVC compatibility. Removed lifilper, in71, out71, inp41, outp41 from mac OS distribution. lifilper will be removed in the next LIFUTILS release.
The textlif utility was enhanced to write HP-41 specific implementation bytes.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.8</td><td>
Extended output options for lifdir and lifheader. Removed lifilper. Fixes in lif_phy_linux.c. Better error diagnostics in lif_img.c. Added switch in lifinit to zero the data area. Added tutorial. inp41, outp41, in71 and out71 are now available on all platforms. All existing documentation checked and updated.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.9</td><td>
Merged pull request 3: make LIFUTILS build on non LINUX Unices, fix potential side effect in comp41.c.  Add -l option to lifget, lifput, lifpurge, lifrename, textlif to relax file name checking of lif files and allow them to have underscores. Documented the -p switch for floppy disk access (LINUX only). Renamed the text75 program to liftext75 to ensure naming consistency. Added the textlif75 and lexcat75 utilites.
<tr><td>v1.7.10</td><td>
The output of the program lexcat75 is now similar to the output of the HP-75 HELP lex file. The lexcat71 program does not show invalidated text table entries any more. The computation of the checksum in rom41er, rom41hx and rom41lif now strictly uses only the lower 10 bits.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1.7.11</td><td>
Fixed the volume/header information in rom41er, rom41hx and rom41lif.
