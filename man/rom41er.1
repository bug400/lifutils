.SH NAME
rom41er \- a filter to convert an unscrambled HP-41 rom file to a LIF file that can be used by the Eramco MLDL-OS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rom41er
.I <LIF filename>
.B <
.I Input file
.B >
.I Output file
.PP
.B rom41er \-?
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Eramco MLDL-OS ROM set can load HP41 ROM images from disk, and the
file format used has become a de facto standard for such images. It stores 4
10 bit HP41 words in 5 bytes of the file. A 4K ROM dump is thus stored in
a 5120 byte file.
.PP
.B rom41er
is a filter which generates a  LIF file of type X-M41 (E070).
The filter reads the rom data from standard input and writes the LIF 
file header and the rom data in scrambled Eramco MLDL-OS format
to standard output. Note: This filter adjusts an incorrect ROM checksum.
.SH EXAMPLES
If
.I HPILDv1B.ROM 
is the rom file of the HP-IL development module then
.PP
.B cat HPILDv1B.ROM | rom41er HPILDEV | lifput lifimage.dat
.PP 
will put the scrambled rom file with the name
.I HPILDEV
into the LIF image file
.I lifimage.dat
