.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lifget
extracts a single file, specified by 
.I filename
from a LIF disk image.
.I filename
is case\-sensitive and should normally be given in upper case. If 
.B lifget
is executed with 3 arguments after the options then the third argument is 
used as the name of the linux file that the LIF file is copied to. If 
only 2 arguments are given then the file is copied to standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-r
Remove the  32\-byte header consisting of the directory 
record from the LIF disk directory from the beginning of the output file.
.TP
.I \-b
Copy the blocks occupied by the file (including the entire last block) 
rather then the number of bytes given by the file length. This option has 
no meaning for file types where the file is always assumed to occupy 
complete blocks.
.TP
.I \-?
Print a message giving the program usage to standard error.
.SH EXAMPLES
If 
.I disk1.lif
is a LIF disk image containing a file called 
.I TEST1
then 
.PP
.B lifget disk1.lif TEST1 lif_test_file
.PP
will copy the file TEST1 from the LIF disk image to the linux file
.I lif_test_file.
.SH REFERENCES
The LIF disk directory format is documented in the
.I HP\-IL Interface Owners Manual for the HP\-71 (Hewlett\-Packard)
with further details (particularly HP41 and HP75 file types) in the 
.I HP\-41 Synthetic Quick Reference Guide (Jeremy Smith)
.SH BUGS
Not all file types have been tested.
