About
=====
LIFUTILS are command line utilities to handle various LIF
(Hewlett Packard Logical Interchange Format) files and media images.

See the doc/readme.html file for more information about features and usage.

LIFUTILS were tested on LINUX, Windows 7 and MAC/OS.

Note: there is experimental support for the access of floppy devices to
read and write HP9114 floppy disks under LINUX. Due to lack of hardware this 
has not been tested up to now. Floppy disk support will n o t work with
USB floppy devices.
